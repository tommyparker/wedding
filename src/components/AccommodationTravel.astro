    <h2>Accommodation & Travel</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-12">The Tithe Barn is located in Symondsbury, a small village in Dorset. It's great spot for a weekend away, and you should totally make a trip out of it.</h3>

            While the most convenient option is to stay at the venue, and is great for a tipsy stumble back, it’s unfortunately not the cheapest. They have a range of cottages to choose from, ranging from 2-bed to 10-bed (great if there’s a few people you also know coming). Though, if you want to make a trip out of it, there are plenty of walks, shops and a cafe.

            A nice coastal option by the sea and only a 5 minute drive from the venue. Breakfast included.
