            The most convenient option is to stay at the venue, and is great for a tipsy stumble back. They have a range of cottages to choose from, ranging from 2-bed to 10-bed (great if there's a few people you also know coming).

            A nice coastal option by the sea and only a 5 minute drive from the venue. Breakfast included.
